## Features

- Physically Based Rendering (PBR): Rendero utilizes state-of-the-art PBR techniques to accurately simulate the interaction of light with materials, resulting in lifelike and believable scenes.

- Dynamic Materials: With Rendero's flexible material system, you can create complex and visually rich materials that respond realistically to light and environmental conditions, giving your scenes a higher level of detail and authenticity.

- Post-processing Effects: Enhance the visual quality of your renders with a wide range of post-processing effects, including depth of field, motion blur, tone mapping, bloom, and more. These effects add cinematic depth and polish to your final output.

- Scalability: Rendero is designed to take advantage of modern hardware and offers scalability options, allowing you to render on a single machine or distribute the workload across a network of computers for increased performance and faster render times.
