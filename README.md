# Pixy
This is a pixelated add-on in Blender. 
To access it, go to the Pixy file on the 
main folder and go to Blender. 
Make sure you have Blender installed first, 
though and then launch it. Pixy is compatible 
with Blender versions 2.80 and up. Copy and paste
the script in the Scripting tab of Blender
and run the script. There should be no
problems with the script. 
Congratulations! You have successfully 
downloaded Pixy!
